# E32-900T30S Shield
 LoRa IoT Module

Electronic circuit designed to communicate between the E32-900T30S module and a microcontrolled/embedded system.

- The J1 connector is designed to fit into a Raspberry Pi.
- The J2 connector was designed to be used on a breadboard.
- The J3 connector was designed to be used with other projects (by the author) that have this type of connector.
- The control signal "LORA_ON" allows turning the module on and off.
- The GND_ON control signal is a signal sent from another board that enables/disables the board's GND. In this case, resistor R1 must be soldered. If you don't need to control the board's GND, just solder resistor R2.
